        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>Greetings, while entering my website, you should get to know me. My name is Leah Guthrie, and I am a student in high school. My main focus is to excel in school and really think about what career is fit for me in the future. My interests are cooking, cheerleading, and dancing. In high school I would really put myself out there with dance and cheer, and I'm not a shy person. I wasn't always like this, but once I entered freshman year, I knew I had to step out of my comfort zone. I still have a long way to go, but I am interested in where my high school journey takes me. </p>
